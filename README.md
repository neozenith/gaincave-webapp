# GainCave Webapp

WIP trying to build a serverless API through AWS API Gateway / Lambda and the front end is a statically hosted React App.

TODO:
 - Get a POST Lambda deployed
 - Get a POST lambda saving to MongoDB Atlass
 - Secure the API using Cognito
 - Create the React form
 - Deploy the react form
 - Create a Login component
 - Login component should get a session from Cognito
 - Get the react form to "be logged in", eg have an auth token.
 - Get the React form to securely post to the API.
